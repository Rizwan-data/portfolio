## Projects 
### Arla Foods: Decarbonization and Mitigation Strategies
MSc Data Science for Business, University of Stirling (2024) (Disseration)
### **Arla Foods: Decarbonization and Mitigation Strategies - Portfolio Summary**  

#### **Objective**  
- Developed a data-driven strategy to help **Arla Foods** achieve its goal of **30% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by 2030**.  
- Identified key **performance indicators (KPIs)** affecting carbon footprint in dairy farms.  
- Built a **scenario-based analysis tool** to provide **tailored recommendations** for individual farms.  

#### **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
- **Collected and analyzed Climate Check dataset** from Arla Foods, containing farm-level emissions data.  
- **Identified key contributors** to carbon footprint: **Feed inefficiency, Protein efficiency, Land use, Fertilizer application, and Animal mortality**.  
- **Preprocessed data**: Handled missing values, removed redundant columns, and standardized KPIs.  
- **Segmented farms** based on renewable energy and biogas usage for comparative analysis.  

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Correlation analysis**: Measured relationships between KPIs and carbon footprint.  
- **Regression modeling**: Quantified the impact of each KPI on emissions reduction.  
- **Farm categorization**: Grouped farms based on renewable energy and biogas usage to assess sustainability practices.  

#### **Scenario-Based Analysis Tool**  
- **Developed an interactive tool** that compares a farm’s KPIs with the **top 10 farms with the lowest carbon footprint**.  
- **Calculated key improvement areas** by prioritizing KPIs with the highest impact on emissions.  
- **Predicted carbon footprint reduction** based on targeted improvements.  
- **Generated customized action plans** to optimize farming practices and reduce emissions.  

#### **Key Findings & Business Insights**  
✅ **Primary contributors to high carbon footprint**: Feed inefficiency, excessive fertilizer use, and poor land management.  
✅ **Improving protein efficiency and optimizing feed usage** significantly reduces methane emissions.  
✅ **Farms using renewable electricity and biogas had the lowest carbon footprint** compared to those relying on traditional energy sources.  
✅ **Adopting targeted strategies could help Arla achieve its sustainability goals without increasing production costs.**  

#### **Data Visualization & Reporting**  
- **Bar charts & scatter plots**: Showed correlations between KPIs and carbon footprint.  
- **Scenario-based comparison charts**: Demonstrated impact of KPI improvements on emissions reduction.  
- **Clustered bar charts**: Compared average carbon footprint across different farm categories.  

#### **Recommendations & Business Strategy**  
✔ **Adopt precision farming techniques** to optimize resource use and reduce inefficiencies.  
✔ **Encourage biogas and renewable electricity adoption** to lower GHG emissions.  
✔ **Implement a priority-based incentive system** to reward farms making the most impactful changes.  
✔ **Tailor sustainability strategies** based on farm-specific data to maximize effectiveness.  

#### **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data preprocessing and analysis.  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Regression modeling and KPI impact analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization and insight generation.  
- **Plotly** – Interactive charts for scenario-based analysis.  

This project demonstrates **data-driven decision-making in sustainability, advanced data analytics, and business impact modeling**, reinforcing my ability to apply **data science for strategic problem-solving** in corporate sustainability initiatives. 

## **JC Penney Data Analysis Project**  

#### **Objective**  
- Conducted **data analysis** for JC Penney using structured (CSV) and unstructured (JSON) datasets.  
- Processed **product, user, and review data** to generate actionable insights for business decision-making.  

#### **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
- **Merged datasets**: Combined product, user, and review data into a unified structure.  
- **Handled missing values**: Imputed missing values and removed duplicate columns.  
- **Standardized columns**: Renamed columns for consistency and usability.  
- **Created new feature**: Extracted **age from DOB** to analyze customer demographics.  

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Explored dataset structures**: Assessed data shape, column types, and missing values.  
- **Visualized data distribution**: Used histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to understand trends.  
- **Analyzed key relationships**: Examined correlations between ratings, reviews, and product categories.  

#### **Sentiment Analysis & Ratings Standardization**  
- **Identified inconsistencies** between user ratings and review sentiments.  
- **Applied Sentiment Analysis** using **TextBlob** to classify reviews as:  
  - Too Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Too Negative.  
- **Mapped sentiment categories to numerical ratings** to standardize scoring.  
- **Validated correction** by comparing adjusted scores with original ratings.  

#### **Customer Behavior Insights**  
- **Age-wise review analysis**: Examined how different age groups rated products.  
- **State-wise sentiment analysis**: Identified geographical variations in customer satisfaction.  
- **Brand analysis**: Determined top brands based on review count and average score.  

#### **Data Visualization**  
- **Bar charts & Heatmaps**: Illustrated missing data, sentiment distribution, and customer behavior.  
- **Choropleth Map**: Showcased **state-wise average review scores** across the U.S.  
- **Stacked bar charts**: Compared review sentiment before and after adjustment.  

#### **Key Business Insights & Recommendations**  
- **Focus on high-performing brands**: Prioritize brands with high review counts and positive sentiment in marketing.  
- **Improve underperforming brands**: Address issues in brands with high review counts but low ratings.  
- **Enhance customer experience for older demographics**: Tailor services and support based on age-group preferences.  
- **Target engagement in key states**: Improve service quality in states with high review volumes but low satisfaction.  

#### **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, manipulation, and merging.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization.  
- **TextBlob** – Sentiment analysis.  
- **Plotly** – Interactive state-wise visualization.  

This project highlights **data processing, sentiment analysis, and business insights** derived from real-world datasets, demonstrating my ability to **leverage data for strategic decision-making**.
