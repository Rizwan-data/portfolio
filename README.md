## **JC Penney Data Analysis Project**  

#### **Objective**  
- Conducted **data analysis** for JC Penney using structured (CSV) and unstructured (JSON) datasets.  
- Processed **product, user, and review data** to generate actionable insights for business decision-making.  

#### **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
- **Merged datasets**: Combined product, user, and review data into a unified structure.  
- **Handled missing values**: Imputed missing values and removed duplicate columns.  
- **Standardized columns**: Renamed columns for consistency and usability.  
- **Created new feature**: Extracted **age from DOB** to analyze customer demographics.  

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Explored dataset structures**: Assessed data shape, column types, and missing values.  
- **Visualized data distribution**: Used histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to understand trends.  
- **Analyzed key relationships**: Examined correlations between ratings, reviews, and product categories.  

#### **Sentiment Analysis & Ratings Standardization**  
- **Identified inconsistencies** between user ratings and review sentiments.  
- **Applied Sentiment Analysis** using **TextBlob** to classify reviews as:  
  - Too Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Too Negative.  
- **Mapped sentiment categories to numerical ratings** to standardize scoring.  
- **Validated correction** by comparing adjusted scores with original ratings.  

#### **Customer Behavior Insights**  
- **Age-wise review analysis**: Examined how different age groups rated products.  
- **State-wise sentiment analysis**: Identified geographical variations in customer satisfaction.  
- **Brand analysis**: Determined top brands based on review count and average score.  

#### **Data Visualization**  
- **Bar charts & Heatmaps**: Illustrated missing data, sentiment distribution, and customer behavior.  
- **Choropleth Map**: Showcased **state-wise average review scores** across the U.S.  
- **Stacked bar charts**: Compared review sentiment before and after adjustment.  

#### **Key Business Insights & Recommendations**  
- **Focus on high-performing brands**: Prioritize brands with high review counts and positive sentiment in marketing.  
- **Improve underperforming brands**: Address issues in brands with high review counts but low ratings.  
- **Enhance customer experience for older demographics**: Tailor services and support based on age-group preferences.  
- **Target engagement in key states**: Improve service quality in states with high review volumes but low satisfaction.  

#### **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, manipulation, and merging.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization.  
- **TextBlob** – Sentiment analysis.  
- **Plotly** – Interactive state-wise visualization.  

This project highlights **data processing, sentiment analysis, and business insights** derived from real-world datasets, demonstrating my ability to **leverage data for strategic decision-making**.
